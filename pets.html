    <h1>Valentine's Day got you down? Consider adopting a pet who will love you unconditionally!</h1>
    <p>Unlike people who let you down or break up with you, animals will always be there for you! Mostly because they are utterly dependent on you for food and shelter. But you can project whatever anthropomorphized feelings you like on them!</p>
