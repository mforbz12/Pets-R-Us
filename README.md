# Pets-R-Us

The Pets-R-Us Chrome extension encourages love and connection by first changing all of your pages to a bubble gum pink. You may feel confused at first, but don't worry, there is more joy to come. You click on the pop up and you are prompted by a thought-provoking phrase accompanied by a cute image that strikes immediate tenderness into your heart. So, you go to click open a new tab and...what's this? Random dog photos and a reminder that a pet's love is unconditional? You cave and decide to adopt a pet through Petfinder.
